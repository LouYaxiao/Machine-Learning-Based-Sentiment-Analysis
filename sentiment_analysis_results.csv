"Paragraph 141: Whereas developed countries in Europe and the U.S. have recorded high levels of infection and deaths as a consequence of the pandemic, the impact on the African continent has been quite low.",0
"Paragraph 142: Current World Health Organization (WHO) data shows coronavirus confirmed cases in Africa's 54 countries now stand at 1.1 million, against Europe's 4.6 million and America's 6.3 million. Such a huge discrepancy shows that the South, commonly referred to as developing countries, or derogatorily as the Third World, has the necessary social and economic shock absorbers against adversity. Moreover, their resilience has proved to be more internal than foreign. This has increased the level of confidence of developing countries worldwide in tackling daunting challenges.",1
Paragraph 143: But not everyone is happy with the development of the South or the change of its status to the so-called First World. The ongoing decoupling attempt from China by some developed countries shows the lack of goodwill towards the global South in order to maintain the status quo that thrives on the dependency syndrome.,1
"Paragraph 144: There seems to be a sense of entitlement by the developed world that implies exclusivity, creating a perennial master-servant relationship with developing countries.

"Paragraph 149: The UN had the global South in mind when it came up with the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

It is only through close cooperation, concerted effort and determination that developing countries can get out of poverty.",0
"Paragraph 150: However, the South must learn from the mistakes developed countries made in pursuit of industrialization. These include environmental destruction and social destabilization. Development must be accompanied by the fundamental principles of sustainability and inclusivity for it to be meaningful and permanent.",2
"Paragraph 151: China holds the leading light for other developing countries. But its growth in the last 40 years since the launch of reform and opening-up in 1978 has come against much opposition from the developed world.

"Paragraph 176: But what is ""South-South cooperation""? And how it is significant to China's foreign policy goals? Although Western discourse has sought to misrepresent programs such as the BRI and paint China's efforts in wholly cynical terms, for decades China's foreign policy has long been oriented towards consolidating ties with other ""global South"" countries, that being: developing countries that are not part of the established ""West"" and have been subject to colonialism.",1
"Paragraph 177: Evolving from China's own historical experience, this takes the form of principles such as national sovereignty, non-interference in other countries' domestic affairs and mutual development. This is the preliminary logic of the BRI.",1
"Paragraph 178: The foreign policy foundation of the People's Republic of China derives from the country's historical experience of domination by foreign powers. Since 1949, China's diplomatic outlook has shaped in a way that sees benefit in seeking solidarity with countries of a similar experience.",0
"Paragraph 179: Former Chinese premier Zhou Enlai was decisive in shaping this position through his role at the famous Bandung Conference in 1955, whereby he created a foundation for China's relationships with Africa and Latin America.",0
"Paragraph 180: As the Sino-Soviet split took place, the late Chinese leader Mao Zedong crystallized this into a ""three worlds"" theory, with the sphere of the ""third world"" or post-colonial world, non-aligned world standing between the respective United States and Soviet Union spheres within the Cold War system.",0
"Paragraph 181: Although the world has since changed, this foundation nevertheless remains important in China's contemporary diplomacy and its relevance to the BRI. One may note that firstly China does not opt for formal alliances or a purposeful struggle for hegemony, and secondly post-colonial principles such as national sovereignty, equality and mutuality in relations continue to receive emphasis in diplomatic discourse.",1
"Paragraph 183: This in turn is what builds the foundation of the BRI and other development policies: China continues to seek its best interests and national goals through cooperation with similar countries, which is key to prevent domination and challenges to national sovereignty by the West.",0
"Paragraph 184: With many developing countries having suffered from economic exploitation by Western powers, with forced Neoliberal policies having plunged Africa and Latin America into poverty in the 1980s, these nations have grown to see China as an alternative pathway to national development with much less liability, with Beijing's traditional policies allowing these countries to find empathy in the form of a common history, worldview and legacy.",0
"Paragraph 185: On this background, nations around the world have subsequently sought to join the BRI in growing numbers and enhance economic ties with Beijing, which has allowed them to hedge their own autonomy against ""traditional sources of support"" in the West.",1
"Paragraph 186: Therefore, Kiribati has opted to join the BRI program because it recognizes what it has to offer will be wholly beneficial to it.",0
"Paragraph 187: As a small Pacific island nation with limited resources and unable to hold its own weight against Australia and the United States, ties with China do not result in its own ""domination"" or ""subordination"" as Western media misleadingly portrays it, but offers the island greater political space, support and economic opportunity accordingly. The West fails to comprehend this again and again, refusing to accept such decisions as legitimate, honest or authentic.",1
"Paragraph 188: In summary, ""South-South cooperation"" is how we should understand the growth of the BRI, and China's deeper ties to the broader developing, non-Western world. This is not about power, domination or exploitation; instead it is a historically accumulative pathway whereby China has envisioned its best interests in solidarity and coordination with countries of a similar experience.",0
"Paragraph 189: Thus, Beijing is continuing a decades old diplomatic precedent as a means to responding to modern challenges. Consequentially, as Kiribati joins, the leaders of both countries have heralded a new era of ""South-South cooperation"" in the view of spurring development and mutual prosperity in the Pacific.",1

The article reflects the author's opinion and not necessarily those of CGTN.",0
"Paragraph 197: The ninth edition of the FOCAC summit, to take place from September 4 to 6, returns to its inaugural city, Beijing. The summit series has come a long way, having rotated between Beijing and Addis Ababa (2003), Sharm el-Sheikh (2009), Johannesburg (2015), and Dakar (2021). The 2024 FOCAC summit is thus both a confirmation of value in summitry between its participants and a demonstration of commitment for maintaining the momentum of government-initiated cooperation to promote economic development.",2
"Paragraph 198: During the quarter of a century since FOCAC's inauguration in October 2000, basic tenets undergirding interactions between governments, societies, and peoples of the world have gone through profound changes. Economic growth through efficiency-driven utilization of resources and promotion of industrialization in developing countries and trade with them has fallen out of fashion. In its place, more and more high-income governments adopted the notion of economic security in relation to those in middle-and-low-income levels of development. This often results in policies that leave steeper ladders for middle- and low-income economies to climb.",1
Paragraph 199: This makes it fitting to view the ninth FOCAC as a manifestation of the value of South-South Cooperation (SSC) in the 21st century.,0
"Paragraph 200: The core feature of SSC is pursuit of cooperation ""by the South and for the South."" What began as a demonstration of political and diplomatic solidarity in the 1950s, which led to the United Nations (UN) declaration on the establishment of a new international economic order in 1974, waned in the 1980s, in part due to the shift from North-South dialogue to neoliberalism as the prevailing doctrine of global development governance.",2
"Paragraph 201: But the spirit of SSC survived. For example, the South Commission (1987-1990), under the leadership of Julius Nyerere, then president of Tanzania, worked to keep highlighting systematic challenges for the South and succeeded in having its reports included in the United Nations general assembly documents. Creation of the inter-governmental South Center, in July 1995, is a marker of the renaissance of the movement, if only with a change from political solidarity to valuing the South as source of intellectual wisdom and policy support.",0
"Paragraph 202: With the United Nations moving to establish the Office for South-South Cooperation in 2013, centering on addressing development challenges in middle-and low-income economies received broad recognition. Although SSC had been in the portfolio of the UN system dating back to the beginning of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) in 1965, it was a treated as work of a special unit only. Suffice to note that under the UNDP, SSC cooperation projects evolved as spur from North-South cooperation and dialogue. China was active in the UNDP's promotion of trilateral development cooperation projects, including those implemented in China itself.",2
"Paragraph 204: On September 26, 2015, President Xi Jinping and the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, jointly hosted the high-level roundtable on SSC. The larger background of the event was movement from the Millennium Development Goals to the 2023 Agenda for Sustainable Development.",0
"Paragraph 205: It must be noted that African countries were from the start a major force of SSC, including with China as a core participant. Development, a common human aspiration, is what brought China and Africa into institutionalized contact, dating back to the 1950s. As a matter of fact, the China-funded Tanzania-Zambia Railway, whose operation commenced in 1976, was singularly the most tangible manifestation of friendship and cooperation between Africa and China during those decades.",0
"Paragraph 206: Africa embraced trade and investment outreach by Japan, with the establishment of the Tokyo International Conference on African Development (TICAD) in 1993. As a matter of fact, TICAD served as an inspiration for FOCAC. In addition, over the past two decades, the African Union has entered into institutionalized development partnerships with Brazil, India and T邦rkiye, among others.",0
"Paragraph 207: As summarized in a UNDP report, among African countries themselves, SSC flourished, enhancing collaboration, integration and intra-African partnerships towards the 2030 and 2063 agendas. Either through the UN system or through such mini-lateral groupings as the Group of Seven (G7), Africa has sought opportunities for harnessing resources and ideational input to address development challenges on the continent.",0
"Paragraph 208: The establishment of the Lobito Corridor project comes to mind as a good example of space for external commitment to long-term growth on the continent. The corridor has been in place for over a decade, with investment from both Europe and China. Upgrading and expanding the existing railway system brings about benefits to economies of the line services, in addition to serving the needs for green energy transition in the rest of the world. An ideal development is for the Benguella railway and the Tazara railway to be connected to serve as a transportation link between the Indian and Atlantic oceans.",2
"Paragraph 209: The sketch above is far from doing justice to the proliferation of Africa-centered international cooperation projects, whether or not they are framed as SSC. My purpose here is to remind observers of the ninth FOCAC in particular and China-Africa cooperation in general of utility in keeping in mind African agency and power in affecting input, material and ideation to the African continent.",0
"Paragraph 210: As such, one way to view the significance of the ninth FOCAC is not so much what China can do for Africa, certainly not solely through a pledged amount of investment or increase in trade. Rather, it is more useful to treat the summit as an affirmation of commitment to the development philosophy that the essence of governance is the betterment of the livelihood of people. Ideas and projects that can be categorized as South-South Cooperation in the 21st century must be made to be fit for the purpose of development needs in both China, Africa and the rest of the Global South.",1
"Paragraph 211: It is as important to note that, more so than in the past, for South-South Cooperation in the 21st century to retain its relevance and vitality, there can be no one-size-fits-all in philosophizing and/or project design and execution. Instead, devotion to mutual learning and collaborative exploration, including that with skeptics and even critics of China-Africa engagement, is essential. African countries and China continue to go through a learning by doing process in development cooperation. Such is the spirit and value of the ninth FOCAC.",2

The two sides have complementary strengths in resources, markets, and industries. Their collaboration in fields such as energy, trade, and investment has been continuously enhanced, expanded, and upgraded. This has set a model for South-South cooperation and mutual benefits.",1
"Paragraph 245: Energy cooperation has been consolidated as the core to pioneer a new model of the Sino-Arab energy cooperation. China is the world's second-largest economy and the largest importer of oil, while the Arab countries are among the most significant areas producing oil and gas globally. Enhancing energy cooperation and establishing a Sino-Arab partnership in energy supply and demand, form the cornerstone of Sino-Arab cooperation.",1

Sino-Arab energy cooperation has thus entered a new phase of extensive, sustainable collaboration in such fields as carbon-based energy, renewable energy, and the peaceful utilization of nuclear energy.",1
"Paragraph 248: The quality of infrastructure cooperation is enhanced to support new infrastructure development in Arab countries. The diversified development of the Arab economies has given rise to a substantial demand for high-level infrastructure, while China boasts robust technological and economic advantages in building infrastructure, creating vast opportunities for mutual complementary cooperation.
