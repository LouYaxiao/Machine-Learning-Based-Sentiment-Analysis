"Paragraph 7: A man scavenges clothes from debris burnt down by the fire in the early morning at Gikomba market, East Africa's largest second hand clothing market, in Nairobi, Kenya, on Nov. 8, 2021.",-1
"Paragraph 8: The fast fashion industry has boomed tremendously in recent years – with Western countries leading the world in consumption and secondhand clothing exports, which are clogging developing countries and landfills with used clothing.",-1
"Paragraph 9: Fast fashion aims to provide consumers with cheap, fashionable garments that are produced quickly and up-to-date on high-fashion trends, often at the expense of laborers and the environment. While social media has certainly accelerated the trend cycle and given consumers increased access to low-priced, fleeting clothing, American overconsumption is not a new fad. It's been around for decades, and it's been inching the world closer to irreversible climate damage as Americans donate their clothing and buy more at increasing rates.",0
"Paragraph 10: A major point of contention at the United Nations Climate Conference – which comes to an end this weekend in Glasgow, Scotland – is the divide between wealthy and developing countries. And just as there is an increasing divide between countries that became rich from fossil fuels powering their economies and poor countries being told those fuels are now too dangerous for the planet, the fast fashion industry is exposing a chasm between wealthy countries exporting used clothing and developing countries becoming textile dumping grounds – and facing the environmental consequences.",1
"Paragraph 11: Currently, the U.S. leads the world in secondhand clothing exports. In 2018, the U.S. exported nearly 719 million kilograms (1.58 billion pounds) in secondhand clothing, over 200 million kg higher than its runner up, Germany. These exports end up in secondhand markets around the world, particularly in the Global South, and often at a rate and volume higher than its recipients can handle.",1
"Paragraph 12: This problem is especially pronounced across Africa, which counts six of the top 20 countries for secondhand clothing imports – Kenya, Angola, Tunisia, Ghana, Tanzania and Uganda – and South Asia, where Pakistan and India receive the highest and second-highest volume of secondhand clothes worldwide.",0
"Paragraph 13: Specifically in Africa, secondhand clothing from Western countries clogs local markets and landfills. The textiles travel from retail secondhand stores to private third parties and containers and are eventually sold to overseas entities, which upcycle – or revamp – the clothes before reselling them according to Sarah Bibbey, the co-founder and acting director of Make Fashion Clean, a non-profit organization working to make denim consumption more sustainable globally.",1
"Paragraph 14: In Ghana, these clothes – which are called ""Obroni Wawu"" in the Akan language, or ""Dead White Man's Clothes"" — are purchased in bales by market traders who do not know what is in them for $25 to $500 each before being repaired and revamped as necessary and eventually making their way to Ghanian secondhand markets. However, the increasingly poor quality of fast fashion clothing makes it difficult for upcyclers (people who revamp and recycle used clothing) to give these clothes a new life, forcing them to be discarded at landfills which, in turn, has detrimental impacts on the local environment.",-2
"Paragraph 15: ""Our landfills (in the U.S.) are equipped in such a way that they can process chemicals and they can kind of be contained whereas in other countries, including Ghana, it's not the same level of infrastructure around the landfill,"" Bibbey noted.",1
"Paragraph 16: In terms of deciding where the clothes go after Americans discard them, power dynamics and colonial histories play a role in where secondhand clothes are diverted to.",0
"Paragraph 17: ""Any country that is [...] a formerly colonized country, or country that's not a global superpower, is going to be more vulnerable to clothing dumping in general,"" Bibbey said. ""So any country that we know of is going to be more vulnerable to that just because the political power that they have in the global arena is not the same as the political power the U.S. has in the global arena – so that's the most important thing, I think.""",0
Paragraph 19: JACQUES NKINZINGABO|AFP VIA GETTY IMAGES,0
"Paragraph 20: Secondhand clothes are displayed to sell at Gisozi Market in Kigali, Rwanda, in 2018.",0
"Paragraph 21: While resistance to Western clothing dumping has taken root in East Africa, the U.S. has leveraged its global influence and financial aid to ensure that it can still export secondhand clothes to African markets.",-1
"Paragraph 22: In 2017, the East African countries of Rwanda, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, South Sudan and Burundi tried to phase out imports of secondhand clothing and shoes because of the way they undermined domestic efforts to develop their own textile industries. The countries sought to ban these imports entirely by 2019.",0
"Paragraph 23: However, in March of 2017, the Office of the United States Trade Representative threatened to remove four of these six East African countries from the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act, a preferential trade deal intended to lift trade and economic growth across sub-Saharan Africa. Burundi and South Sudan had already been expelled from the trade deal under accusations of state violence.",0
"Paragraph 24: A combination of factors make the U.S. a hotbed for fast fashion consumption above consumers in other wealthy countries. While Americans of all income levels contribute to the fast fashion crisis, Charlotte Tate – the Labor Justice Campaigns director for Green America, a U.S.-based nonprofit organization that promotes ethical consumption – points to America's model of capitalism and wage stagnation as some of the factors driving American overconsumption.",2
"Paragraph 25: ""I think one thing that's unique to American capitalism is how much we prioritize working to make more money and then you have more money to spend,"" she said. ""And another factor to consider is fast fashion is much cheaper than higher quality goods. When you look at wages over the past few decades, they've really stagnated. And as Americans have become more productive, the wealth of productivity hasn't been distributed evenly. In that case, you know, it would be really challenging if you're not making enough money to make ends meet to then also buy higher quality clothes.""",2
"Paragraph 26: But consumers that don't have the means to buy higher quality goods are not the only group lining up at fast fashion stores. Americans of all income levels consume fast fashion, and higher priced clothes don't necessarily equate to more sustainably, ethically produced clothes.",0
Paragraph 27: MORE:,0
Paragraph 28: How Climate Change May Increase Global Conflicts,0
"Paragraph 29: Bibbey also highlights the culture around clothing donations as part of what fuels overconsumption and clothing dumping in the U.S., as consumers buy too much with the idea of being able to donate their clothes later.",0
"Paragraph 30: ""People might hear that their clothes ended up somewhere and they might think that that's always 100% a good thing, just because there's that mindset of American saviorism that we have here,"" Bibbey said. ""We get the idea that that's a good thing, even when we see in reality it's putting local artisans and local clothing makers out of business because they're competing in a sense with this influx of secondhand clothes.""",0
Paragraph 31: But Tate says that American consumers are not the principal blame for the fast fashion dumping crisis.,0
"Paragraph 32: ""I think that corporations know that they're producing cheap clothing that won't last long and that often can't be reused – and they've known it for a while,"" she said. ""So I would say a bulk of the responsibility falls on corporations and our practices, and then also to some extent it would fall on our government that has the power to regulate, that maybe hasn't.""",1
Paragraph 33: Because of the unique intensity at which Americans consume and dump clothes – with news reports citing a fivefold increase in the amount of clothing Americans have purchased over the past three decades and an average of only seven uses per item – the U.S. requires unique solutions to the global fast fashion crisis.,3
"Paragraph 34: With the U.N. Climate Conference coming to a close, coming up with solutions to these pressing environmental problems is a top priority, advocates say. And, just as the blame for this crisis cannot fall solely on consumers, environmental activists say solutions need to be sought beyond the consumer level, too.",2
"Paragraph 35: On a smaller scale, Bibbey points to upcycling both in the U.S. and in developing countries as a way to mitigate the impacts of fast fashion on the environment, highlighting Make Fashion Clean's partnership with the Ghana-based MFI Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to upcycling clothes in partnership with local artisans in Ghana, as an example of this. But they say the more global, overarching solutions still need to be ""studied"" and ""examined.""",1
"Paragraph 36: ""Consumers have a lot of power, so while they're not directly responsible for some of the problems facing society today, they do have a lot of power to change market demands and to change their shopping habits,"" Tate said. ""We have found that when consumers speak and reach directly to corporations, they do change their practices. Collective action is very powerful. So, if we all act and change our practices, we do have the power to reform.""",0

"Paragraph 88: The program championed by Chinese leader Xi Jinping has financed construction of ports, power plants, railroads and other projects around the world.",0
"Paragraph 89: “Over the past 10 years, the fruitful results of building the Belt and Road together and the growing circle of friends have fully proved that the Belt and Road does not engage in a closed and narrow circle, transcends the old mindset of geopolitical games and creates a new paradigm of international cooperation,” Li Kexin, the Foreign Ministry's director for international economics affairs, told reporters in Beijing.",0
"Paragraph 90: Since it was launched, the Belt and Road Initiative, or BRI, has backed projects carried out mostly by Chinese construction companies, financed by loans from Chinese development banks.",1
Paragraph 91: Its official goal is to boost trade and investment by improving China's transport links with the rest of the world. Analysts credit the program with directing needed funding to poor countries but say that came at a cost.,0
"Paragraph 92: A study released Monday by Boston University's Global Development Policy Center said the BRI had delivered more than $330 billion in loans to developing country governments through 2021, lending more than the World Bank in some years.",1

"Paragraph 117: Those are the conclusions of a report published this week by the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation in Washington, D.C. The research is part of a yearlong project that will examine the impact of China's economic rise on global technological innovation.",0
"Paragraph 118: Globalization and an overall strong level of cooperation between developed nations and low-wage economies has historically incentivized innovation. But China's growing role in the global economy has negatively affected research and development, ITIF says. That is due to China's government heavily subsidizing domestic companies, manipulating currency levels to obtain unfair price advantages in foreign economies, and making use of intellectual property that is doesn't pay for, the report argues.",1
"Paragraph 120: ""These and other policies have conferred an unfair advantage to Chinese companies – which on average are significantly less innovative than their foreign competitors, the very reason China embarked on its 'innovation mercantilist' efforts,"" says Robert Atkinson, president of ITIF, in the report.",0
"Paragraph 121: According to the ITIF research, China's low-wage economy has motivated developed countries such as Canada, the United States and in Europe to look at relocating production instead of focusing on developing technologies that would allow them to produce more efficiently and at a lower cost in-house. As a consequence, companies have also redesigned production processes and adapted them to manual labor instead of machines, making them less efficient and less innovative overall, the report argues.",1
"Paragraph 122: ""Low-cost production options can affect product design decisions, thereby boosting short-term consumer welfare at the cost of dynamic efficiency (innovation) and long-term consumer welfare,"" Atkinson writes. That is particularly concerning in areas where governments can manipulate the cost of production and keep the cost of labor low, such as in China, he adds in the report.",0
"Paragraph 123: In addition, companies operating in industries exposed to more import competition from China have seen a reduction in investment in research and development due to concerns regarding unfair trade practices.",2
"Paragraph 124: ""The nature of Chinese economic and trade policy is so distortive, it ends up harming more innovative companies in many foreign countries,"" Atkinson says.",0
"Paragraph 125: Trade barriers can also limit gains for most efficient companies if foreign firms struggle to access economies where domestic players are favored. Experts have complained that unconditional support for Chinese companies facing lower risks has hurt innovation, as well as fair competition and the entrepreneurial spirit altogether. The global cost of innovation also rises when too many firms more firms than necessary, the ITIF warns.",2
"Paragraph 126: ""Unfair, innovation mercantilist-based trade can have the effect of reducing profits by leading to more market overcapacity and lower prices for competitive products than what market forces would produce,"" Atkinson says.",0
"Paragraph 127: Solutions for tackling the upcoming challenges in innovation and fair competition should include policies that would make China play by the global set rules, he says.",0
"Paragraph 128: ""If policymakers want to ensure robust rates of global innovation going forward, working to ensure China plays by the rules they agreed to when they joined WTO (World Trade Organization) is a critical task,"" Atkinson concludes in the report.",1

"Paragraph 148: China has tried to position itself as a leader of the Global South, a catchphrase for the developing world.

Paragraph 178: China is telling assembled world leaders at the United Nations that it considers itself part of the Global South,0
Paragraph 179: By Associated Press,0
Paragraph 180: |,0
"Paragraph 181: Sept. 21, 2023, at 6:55 p.m.",0
"Paragraph 182: UNITED NATIONS (AP) — China told assembled world leaders Thursday that it considers itself part of the Global South, saying it identifies with the goals and challenges of less-developed nations and offering them an alternative to what it has long called “Western hegemony.” The message came from a second-tier official after the country's powerful president, Xi Jinping, skipped the annual U.N. meeting again.",2
Paragraph 183: Xi sent Vice President Han Zheng to deliver a policy statement at the General Assembly's leaders' meeting that covered the government's usual positions with familiar language but appeared to focus on building coalitions around its approach to development and international relations.,1
"Paragraph 184: “As the largest developing country, China is a natural member of the Global South. It breathes the same breath with other developing countries and shares the same future with them,” Han said. He also said China supports those nations' development path “in keeping with their national conditions.”",2
"Paragraph 185: The loosely defined term “Global South,” which has come up frequently at the United Nations this year, identifies nations around the world that are less developed and less rich than what have typically been called “first-world nations.” They're not necessarily in the Southern Hemisphere; many, in fact, are not.",0
"Paragraph 186: Leaders of a number of larger developing nations, including Brazil's Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and India's Narendra Modi, have of late pitched themselves as leaders around whom the Global South could coalesce. Just Tuesday, Lula told leaders at the U.N. meeting that “Brazil is back” in a speech widely received as Global South-focused maneuvering. And Modi in January hosted a “Voice of the Global South” virtual summit.",0
"Paragraph 187: China, too, has loosely cast itself in a similar role for more than a decade — and more so since Xi launched the “Belt and Road Initiative” to drive Chinese development, infrastructure and influence in other nations, particularly developing ones. The sprawling project has been widely touted but has encountered bumps along the way.",1
"Paragraph 188: “China,” Han promised, “will remain a member of the big family of developing countries.”",0
Paragraph 189: That statement is in keeping with Beijing’s attempts to balance — often adeptly — the benefits of continuing to be a developing nation with the advantages of being a major global economic and diplomatic power and counterbalance to the West.,1
"Paragraph 190: For decades, since the start of the “reform and opening up” launched by Deng Xiaoping after Mao Zedong's death in 1976, China has positioned its approach to both domestic and international affairs as an alternative to “Western hegemony.” That counternarrative is a frequent cornerstone of its international identity. Han's “Global South” statements Thursday match that longtime sensibility.",1
"Paragraph 191: And China benefits from association with the Global South, which allows it to style statements as if it speaks for many nations — nations that may not be strong enough to object if such a powerful government mischaracterizes them.",1
"Paragraph 193: Whether China and its $18 trillion GDP should actually be considered part of the Global South is a frequently debated matter. In January, at Modi's summit, 125 countries were included but China wasn't one of them. That may have had more to do with China's often-tense relations with India than with its attitude toward the concept in general.",0
"Paragraph 194: Xi was one of four leaders of permanent U.N. Security Council members who did not show at the United Nations this week. France's Emmanuel Macron, Britain's Rishi Sunak and Russia's Vladimir Putin also skipped it; U.S. President Joe Biden, leader of the host nation, was the only permanent Security Council member to deliver a speech.",1
Paragraph 195: Han Zheng's presence at the United Nations came at a time when China's diplomatic operation appears to be in a bit of disarray.,0
"Paragraph 196: Many expected Foreign Minister Wang Yi to come to the General Assembly and possibly pave the way for a Xi-Biden meeting. Wang attended and delivered the speech last year. In the months since, a newly appointed foreign minister came and went with some mystery, and Wang took the role on again.",0
"Paragraph 197: Han, in his speech, covered China's usual topics in such meetings. Among them:",0
"Paragraph 198: — He reiterated that Taiwan, the island off China's coast that has its own independent government, is historically a part of China and always will be — a frequent message to the United States and the world. The island and the mainland split in 1949 after a civil war.",0
"Paragraph 199: — He said China supported human rights “suited to our national conditions in response to the needs of our people.” Beijing's repressive policies toward ethnic Uyghurs in the western region of Xinjiang and its policies toward dissent, including in the special administrative region of Hong Kong, come under frequent Western scrutiny.",0
"Paragraph 200: — He said, as China has many times before, that a cease-fire and peace talks are the only path to ending war in Ukraine. China has tread a delicate line in the 18 months since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.",0

Countries may struggle to get or repay loans from these institutions because they have to use the income from their natural resources — typically crucial to their economies — to pay off resource-tied debts, he said.",3
